// Package tune works out, from what one user's agents really did, the
// settings that would have cost that user the fewest tokens: when each
// agent compacts its conversation, and how long Claude Code keeps its
// prompt cache. Every setting is tried on the user's own calls of the
// period, replayed one by one: the same prompts growing by the same
// amounts at the same times, compacted or read from the cache as the
// setting would have had them. What it says is so for this user and this
// agent only; another's habits give other answers.
//
// Tokens are weighed by what the vendor charges for them against a plain
// input token, which is what a subscription's quota and an API bill both
// count: a cache read is a tenth of one, a cache write a quarter more (two
// for an hour's), an output token several.
