// (claude-opus-4.6, relay/claude-opus-4.6-us), which Claude Code 2.1.296
// reads as Claude Opus 4: it warns the model is retired, asks with budget
// thinking and 32000 output tokens, and offers no effort, whether its
// settings.json names the model by id or by "opus" (misteer_ti. on
// Discord). So a served Claude model with a dotted version is given to
// Claude Code with dashes (ClaudeSpelled), and the gateway takes that
// spelling back to the served id (ClaudeUndashed). Other vendors' ids are
// never respelled.
