// A model its vendor has retired, though the vendor's own list still names
// it (MOMO on Discord: OpenCode Zen's /v1/models still lists exo-free,
// and a request for it gets 410 {"type":"error","error":{"type":
// "ModelDeprecated","message":"Model exo-free has been deprecated."}}).
// The gateway tells Retire when a provider answers so; the model is then
// left out of the catalog — /v1/models, every agent's model list, the
// routing groups magpie finds — for that provider only, until it answers
// a request again or retiredFor has passed. A request that names it as
// "provider/model" is still sent, so the vendor's answer is what the
// agent is told, and a model back in service is seen at once.
