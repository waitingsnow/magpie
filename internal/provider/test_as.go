// A relay can serve only the agents its plan is sold for, and tell them by
// the headers they send: "This account only allows Codex official
// clients", "only accessible via the official Claude CLI". The gateway
// lets those headers go on to a provider reached with a key, as the agent
// sent them (gateway.go: fromCodex, fromClaudeCode), so the agent's own
// requests are served, while a test request, magpie's own, was turned away
// and said the provider didn't work (耍赖天都爱 on Discord). A test can be
// asked as one of them asks instead (TestAs): on the API that agent's
// requests go to, streamed as they are, with the headers the gateway last
// let through for it.
//
// Claude Code's are never made up: they are the ones a Claude Code request
// that came through this magpie had, and they go to a relay alone, never to
// Anthropic's own API or a cloud's, nor to a signed-in account. Until
// Claude Code has come through, a test as it says so. Codex's, until Codex
