// Reading the Library page compares skill folders whole: an agent's own
// skill against the same name in another agent (foundSkills), and each
// agent's copy against the library's skill (behind). Each compare read
// every byte of both folders on every read of the page, so a few dozen
// skills with node_modules or templates in them, given to several agents,
// read hundreds of megabytes each time the page opened; on Windows, with
// every file read scanned, that is minutes (0day404, #541). What a compare
// or a hash found is kept here against what a walk of the folders sees
// without opening a file: each entry's place, size and time. While those
// are the same, the answer is too. A folder that couldn't be walked or
// read whole is unknown: it is read again next time, never taken as
// unchanged.
