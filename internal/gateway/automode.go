// Claude Code's auto mode checks each action with a classifier (#250).
// Behind a gateway, its first requests ask the API to do it: the
// dangerous-tool-use beta and a `safeguards` field, answered by
// `safeguard_results` in the reply: a whole reply's own, a stream's in its
// message_delta. Anthropic's own API (and a relay in front of it) gets them
// as they were sent, relayed or built (buildAnthropic), and the results
// come back as it gave them, on a stream made of a whole reply too
// (anthropicWholeEvents). Any other model neither sees them nor answers
// them (serverReview), and Claude Code, finding no result, classifies
// locally for the rest of the session, naming the gateway in a notice.
// magpie says nothing on the API's behalf, and doesn't turn the review off
// in Claude Code's settings: /model can take the same session to a Claude
// model behind the gateway, which reviews it.
//
// Locally, the classifier is a request of its own on the session's model:
// the transcript in <transcript> blocks, a system prompt asking for
// <block>yes</block> or <block>no</block>, thinking turned off, and for its
// first stage 64 tokens to answer in (stopping at </block>). A model that
// reasons whatever it is told spends those 64 tokens reasoning and answers
// nothing, which Claude Code reads as no verdict and blocks the action.

// and the safeguards: a vendor that checks the fields it is sent turns the
// whole request away over them. Neither does a body p is no longer asked
// the beta for, having turned it away (Bedrock's "Unexpected value(s)"):
