package library

// magpie's own MCP servers on whichever computer reads the library (#1439).
// InstallServer gives magpie-image this magpie's binary by full path, and
// that path is right only here: a library carried to another computer (a
// WebDAV or S3 sync, a backup put back) came with C:\Users\…\Downloads\
// magpie-windows-amd64.exe on a Mac, or a Mac's app on Windows, and a
// magpie moved out of Downloads left its old path behind. Agents were
// given a program that isn't there, and the page said it can't start.
//
// So a server that is magpie's own — `mcp …` run by a program named
// magpie — and whose program isn't on this computer is pointed at this
// magpie as the library is read (heal), and a carried library names
// magpie's own as plain "magpie" (Collect), which each computer reads as
// its own. Two computers then carry the same library, and a sync doesn't
// write one's path over the other's each time. A magpie program that is
// there (another build kept beside this one) is the user's pick and stays;
// a server run by any other program is never touched.
