// account's allowance or a key's balance on its own — not for the Usage
// page's or tray's timed refresh, the menu bar, alerts, routing, or the
// switch to an account with room. Each shows the reading kept from the
// last time it was read, as of then (keepLast). A read the user asked
// for (Asked) goes out as before, and so does one of an account the
// vendor just turned away for its quota (StaleAllowance), which routing
// must not keep sending to.

// magpie started at login comes up before the proxy app does, and its own
// reads went out direct from the user's real address.
